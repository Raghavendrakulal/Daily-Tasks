Normalization

Normalization is a process of organizing data in order to reduce the redundency.
Single table is divided into multiple tables with related column.

There are six normal forms

1.first normal form
 - Each cell must contains Single or an atomic value;
 -No repeating grps;
 -Each row must be unique;
2. second normal form
 -must be in 1nf;
 -every non prime attributes must be full dependent on primary keys;
3.Third NF
 -must be in 2NF
 -No transitive dependencies. Each non-prime attribute must depend directly on the primary key
4.Boyce codd NF
    -3NF
    Every determinant must be a candidate key. Â  
5.Fourth Normal Form (4NF):

Must be in BCNF.
No multivalued dependencies.
6.Fifth Normal Form (5NF):

Must be in 4NF.
No join dependencies.
